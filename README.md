## 🔐 What is VulnSage?

**VulnSage** is a powerful multi-agent AI system designed to automate source code vulnerability detection using the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). By leveraging Google's **Vertex AI (Gemini 2.5 Pro)** and **LangChain**, it goes beyond traditional pattern matching to understand code semantics, business logic flaws, and novel vulnerability patterns.

Unlike traditional static analyzers that rely on predefined rules, VulnSage uses multiple specialized AI agents that collaborate to provide deep security insights through natural language understanding and reasoning.

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture

VulnSage employs a sophisticated multi-agent system where each agent specializes in different aspects of security analysis:

1. **Vulnerability Analyzer Agent**: Uses LLM reasoning to identify security vulnerabilities by understanding code semantics, not just pattern matching
2. **Architecture Security Agent**: Analyzes system design and architecture for security flaws
3. **Dependency Analysis Agent**: Checks for vulnerable dependencies and supply chain risks
4. **Business Logic Agent**: Identifies complex business logic vulnerabilities that traditional scanners miss
5. **Code Understanding Agent**: Provides deep code comprehension for context-aware analysis
6. **Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates all agents and synthesizes their findings into actionable insights

## 💡 Why Multi-Agent Architecture?

Traditional security tools rely on static patterns and rules, which:
- Miss novel vulnerability types
- Generate many false positives
- Can't understand business logic flaws
- Fail to see vulnerabilities arising from code interactions

VulnSage's multi-agent approach solves these limitations by:
- **Understanding Intent**: AI agents comprehend what the code is trying to do
- **Contextual Analysis**: Considers the broader context and code interactions
- **Adaptive Detection**: Can identify new vulnerability patterns without predefined rules
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Multiple perspectives lead to more thorough analysis

## 📋 Example: AI vs Pattern Matching

**Traditional Scanner**: Looks for `eval()` function calls
**VulnSage AI**: Understands that user input flows into eval(), analyzes the impact, and provides context-specific recommendations

```python
# VulnSage can detect complex vulnerabilities like:
def process_payment(user_data):
    # Looks safe, but AI detects race condition in payment processing
    if check_balance(user_data['account']) >= user_data['amount']:
        deduct_amount(user_data['account'], user_data['amount'])
        process_transfer(user_data['recipient'], user_data['amount'])
```

## 🛡️ Detected Vulnerability Types

VulnSage can detect both common and complex vulnerabilities:

**Standard Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection, XSS, Command Injection
- Path Traversal, XXE, SSRF
- Insecure Deserialization
- Hardcoded Secrets
- Weak Cryptography

**Advanced Detection:**
- Business Logic Flaws
- Race Conditions
- Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU)
- Complex Authentication Bypasses
- Novel Injection Patterns
- API Abuse Scenarios
